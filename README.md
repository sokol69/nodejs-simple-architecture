# Node.js Simple Architecture

Node.js Simple Architecture is a repository where I practiced building application architectures using Node.js. It's designed to serve as a reference for implementing scalable and maintainable architecture patterns in Node.js applications.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Utilizes a modular design approach to organize code into separate components for better maintainability and reusability.
- **Layered Architecture**: Implements a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns between different layers such as routes, controllers, services, and data access.
- **Middleware Integration**: Demonstrates the integration of middleware for handling common tasks such as authentication, error handling, and request logging.
- **Dependency Injection**: Utilizes dependency injection to decouple components and improve testability and flexibility.
